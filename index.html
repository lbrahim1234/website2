        BROOKLYN, YOU ARE TRULY EVERYTHING I COULD EVER ASK FOR IN A PERSON, AND I FEEL LIKE THE LUCKIEST PERSON ALIVE TO HAVE YOU BY MY SIDE. EVERY SINGLE MOMENT I GET TO SPEND WITH YOU FILLS MY HEART WITH SO MUCH LOVE AND GRATITUDE, AND I COULD NEVER FULLY EXPRESS HOW MUCH YOU MEAN TO ME. YOUâ€™RE NOT JUST MY GIRLFRIEND, YOUâ€™RE MY BEST FRIEND, MY ROCK, AND THE ONE PERSON WHO MAKES MY LIFE SO MUCH BETTER JUST BY BEING IN IT. YOU COMPLETELY CHANGE THE WORLD AROUND ME, AND EVERY TIME YOU SMILE, THE WHOLE UNIVERSE LIGHTS UP. THE WAY YOU LAUGH, THE WAY YOU CARE, THE WAY YOU MAKE ME FEEL, ITâ€™S ALL SO PERFECT, AND Iâ€™M FOREVER GRATEFUL THAT YOU CHOSE ME.
        
        I COULD LITERALLY NEVER GET MAD AT YOU, BECAUSE YOUâ€™RE JUST TOO AMAZING TO STAY MAD AT. EVEN WHEN WE GO THROUGH TOUGH TIMES, I KNOW THAT WEâ€™RE IN IT TOGETHER, AND THEREâ€™S NOTHING THAT CAN BREAK US. YOU ALWAYS KNOW HOW TO MAKE ME SMILE, AND YOU ALWAYS KNOW THE RIGHT WORDS TO SAY TO EASE MY WORRIES. YOUR HEART IS SO BIG AND BEAUTIFUL, AND THE WAY YOU LOVE ME IS SOMETHING Iâ€™LL NEVER TAKE FOR GRANTED. I LOVE THE WAY YOUR EYES SPARKLE WHEN YOUâ€™RE HAPPY, AND HOW YOU CARE SO MUCH ABOUT OTHERS. YOUâ€™RE KIND AND CARING, AND YOUR LOVE MAKES EVERYTHING FEEL SO MUCH BETTER. I AM SO INCREDIBLY BLESSED THAT YOUâ€™RE MY GIRLFRIEND.
        
        YOU INSPIRE ME TO BE A BETTER PERSON EVERY DAY. I NEVER THOUGHT I COULD LOVE SOMEONE SO DEEPLY, BUT YOU HAVE OPENED MY EYES TO WHAT REAL LOVE IS. YOUâ€™VE SHOWN ME WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO TRULY BE LOVED, TO BE UNDERSTOOD, AND TO BE SUPPORTED IN WAYS I NEVER KNEW WERE POSSIBLE. YOU MAKE ME WANT TO BE THE BEST VERSION OF MYSELF, AND I WILL SPEND MY LIFE TRYING TO MAKE YOU PROUD AND HAPPY. I KNOW THAT WEâ€™RE A TEAM, AND TOGETHER, THEREâ€™S NOTHING WE CANâ€™T DO. IF YOU EVER STRUGGLE, I WILL BE RIGHT THERE BY YOUR SIDE, HOLDING YOUR HAND THROUGH IT ALL. I WILL BE YOUR STRENGTH WHEN YOU NEED IT, AND YOUR SUPPORT WHEN YOU FEEL WEAK. TOGETHER, WE CAN CONQUER ANYTHING, AND I BELIEVE THAT WITH ALL MY HEART.
        
        YOU ARE MY FIRST TRUE LOVE, AND I WILL NEVER FORGET WHAT A BEAUTIFUL AND INCREDIBLE GIFT IT IS TO LOVE YOU AND BE LOVED BY YOU. YOU SHOW ME EVERY DAY WHAT IT MEANS TO LOVE UNCONDITIONALLY, AND YOU HAVE LITERALLY BROUGHT BACK THE SPARK IN MY LIFE THAT I DIDNâ€™T EVEN KNOW I HAD LOST. I NEVER KNEW HOW EMPTY I FELT BEFORE UNTIL I MET YOU, AND NOW I CANâ€™T IMAGINE A SINGLE DAY WITHOUT YOU IN IT. YOU BRING SO MUCH LIGHT AND BEAUTY INTO MY WORLD, AND YOU MAKE EVERYTHING WE DO TOGETHER SO MUCH MORE MEANINGFUL. WHETHER WEâ€™RE JUST CHILLING AT HOME, LAUGHING ABOUT THE STUPIDEST THINGS, OR GOING ON ADVENTURES, ITâ€™S ALWAYS THE BEST TIME BECAUSE YOUâ€™RE WITH ME. YOUâ€™RE MY EVERYTHING.
        
        I CAN ALREADY PICTURE OUR FUTURE TOGETHER, AND I AM SO EXCITED FOR EVERYTHING THATâ€™S AHEAD. I KNOW WEâ€™RE GOING TO BE AMAZING PARENTS ONE DAY, RAISING OUR LITTLE ONES IN A HOME FULL OF LOVE AND LAUGHTER. YOUâ€™RE GOING TO BE THE BEST MOM, AND Iâ€™LL BE RIGHT THERE WITH YOU, SHARING THE BEAUTY OF PARENTHOOD TOGETHER. WEâ€™RE GOING TO MAKE SO MANY WONDERFUL MEMORIES, AND I CANâ€™T WAIT TO LIVE OUT ALL OUR DREAMS AS A FAMILY. YOU AND I ARE GOING TO GIVE OUR KIDS THE BEST CHILDHOOD EVER, AND THEYâ€™RE GOING TO GROW UP KNOWING WHAT TRUE LOVE IS, BECAUSE WE WILL SHOW THEM EVERY DAY. I CAN SEE IT SO CLEARLY IN MY MIND, AND I KNOW ITâ€™S GOING TO BE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THING WEâ€™LL EVER DO.
